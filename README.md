# About The App

The project was created while attending the [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The project was created to practice the basic [React](https://reactjs.org/) functionalities presented in the course and practice working with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
It is a simple application that allows you to order specific meals with home delivery.


Features:
- Add a certain number of dishes to the cart
- Delete meals from a cart
- Enter the data in the delivery form
